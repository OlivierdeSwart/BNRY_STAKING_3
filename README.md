# Ollie Token Crowdsale: Showcase Project #2
This project introduces the crowdsale of the Ollie token, allowing participants to purchase the token with (Sepolia) Ether. The project's focus is on the development of smart contracts, undertaken independently. 

## Functionality
The smart contract is responsible for holding all funds during the crowdsale period. Should the crowdsale meet its sales goal, the Ollie token is distributed to contributors. If the crowdsale does not reach its goal, Ether contributions are returned to the contributors' wallets.

## Technology Stack
Technologies used include Solidity, JavaScript, Hardhat, React, npm, and node.js.

## Core Technology - Smart Contracts
Central to the project are two key smart contracts:

- Token.sol: This contract creates the Ollie token.
- Crowdsale.sol: This contract enables the core crowdsale functionality, allowing users to purchase the cryptocurrencies mentioned above.
